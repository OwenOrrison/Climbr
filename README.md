# Climbr
---
Climbr is a mobile app created to provide chat rooms for climbers seeking belay parnters, bouldering companions or like-minded people. 

## Motivation
---
This was my first pass at a react-native app. Being so, I spent a long time working out bugs and trying to figure out the most efficient way to learn something new.

## Build Status
---
This project is in a state of semi-completion. I will need to implement more social aspects to make the app more interactive.

## Technology
---
This app is built with React-native, react-native-navigation, node.js, express, and postgresql.
